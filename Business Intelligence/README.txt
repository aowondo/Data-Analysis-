README – Water Billing System Project
Project Overview

This project is an Excel-based water billing and consumption monitoring system designed to streamline utility management for multiple properties. It integrates billing generation, consumption tracking, and operational insights into one centralized file.

To support testing and realistic simulation of the system, a Python-based data generator was developed to create synthetic sample datasets, including controlled consumption spikes and irregular usage patterns. This ensured robust testing of billing logic, anomaly detection, and dashboard performance before deployment with real data.

Objectives

Automate the preparation and tracking of water bills for different houses.

Monitor water consumption patterns and detect unusual spikes.

Enable quick analysis of individual meter usage over time.

Provide a centralized operations dashboard for property managers.

Reduce manual errors and improve efficiency in utility management.

Test system reliability using simulated datasets that mimic real-world water consumption behavior.

Target Insights

Monthly Consumption Trends – Track and compare water usage month-to-month for each house.

High Consumption Alerts – Identify unusual consumption spikes that may indicate leaks or misuse.

Individual Meter Analysis – Drill down into the usage history for a specific meter/house.

Revenue Tracking – Monitor billed amounts versus expected payments.

Operational Summary – Display key metrics in the operations dashboard for quick decision-making.

Tools & Features Used
Excel/VBA

Microsoft Excel – Primary platform for data entry, analysis, and reporting.

VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) – Automates data filtering, form inputs, and bill generation.

Tables & Structured References – Organizes and formats data for consistency and easy expansion.

UserForms – Simplifies the billing data entry process.

PivotTables & Charts – Visualizes trends and anomalies in water usage.

Conditional Formatting – Highlights spikes in consumption or overdue bills.

Dynamic Dashboards – Centralized operational view for management.

Python (Data Generator)

Synthetic Data Creation – Generates test datasets for multiple houses and billing cycles.

Consumption Spikes Simulation – Adds anomalies (e.g., sudden usage surges) to test spike detection logic.

Randomized Normal Usage – Mimics realistic household consumption ranges for testing.

Export to Excel/CSV – Seamlessly integrates with the billing system for testing dashboards and invoices.

Usage

Input monthly meter readings via the form (or load generated datasets for testing).

The system calculates consumption, generates invoices, and logs records in the respective house’s sheet.

The operations dashboard automatically updates with key metrics and insights.

Use the Python data generator to stress-test the system with synthetic data before live use.

Filter and drill down to specific houses or time periods as needed.
